# ***Adobe India Hackathon 2025*** - Corporate Training Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Adobe India Hackathon 2025**! This project showcases my solution to the *Corporate Training – Max Employees* problem, a challenging Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) task from the national-level competition. Here, I share the problem statement, my approach, and a few reflections on the experience. Let's dive in! 💻

## 🧾 Problem Statement

The *Corporate Training – Max Employees* problem was a highlight of the hackathon's Round 1. Here's the full problem statement:

A company is conducting a series of **N** workshops as part of a corporate training program. There are **T** employees participating, and each employee must attend at least **K** workshops to complete the program.

There are two training rooms:

- **Room 1** with capacity **A**, used for odd-numbered workshops (1st, 3rd, 5th...),
- **Room 2** with capacity **B**, used for even-numbered workshops (2nd, 4th, 6th...).

Each workshop can only accommodate a limited number of employees based on the room's capacity. The task is to determine the **maximum number of employees** who can successfully complete the training program (i.e., attend at least **K** workshops) while respecting room capacities.

### 📥 Input Format

A single line with five space-separated integers:

```
T N A B K
```

Where:

- **T**: Total number of employees
- **N**: Total number of workshops
- **A**: Capacity of Room 1 (odd-numbered workshops)
- **B**: Capacity of Room 2 (even-numbered workshops)
- **K**: Minimum number of workshops each employee must attend

### 📤 Output Format

A single integer representing the maximum number of employees who can complete the program.

### 📊 Constraints

```
1 ≤ T, N, A, B, K ≤ 10^9
```

### 🧪 Sample Input/Output

**Sample Input 1:**

```
5 4 5 3 3
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
5
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
10 3 4 4 3
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
4
```

## 💻 Solution

The solution to this problem is implemented in the file `solution.cpp`. The approach leverages efficient algorithmic techniques to calculate the maximum number of employees who can meet the workshop attendance requirement while adhering to room capacity constraints.

## 🗓️ My Hackathon Experience

I participated in the **Adobe India Hackathon 2025** alongside my colleague and friend, **B P ARYAAN**, as part of Round 1 (July 11–12, 2025). The round was intense, with a 1-hour assessment that included:

- **15 rapid-fire MCQs** in 15 minutes, testing core computer science concepts.
- **1 DSA coding challenge** (this problem!) in 45 minutes.

The unique twist? The final team score was an average of individual performances, making both teamwork and personal focus critical. While we didn’t top the leaderboard, the experience was a masterclass in staying calm under pressure, optimizing algorithms on the fly, and navigating real-time proctored assessments. 🕒

## 💭 Reflections

The Adobe India Hackathon 2025 wasn’t just a test of coding prowess—it was a forge for resilience and ingenuity. Wrestling with tight time constraints and complex logic pushed me to rethink my approach to problem-solving, sharpening my instincts for optimization and clarity. Teaming up taught me the art of balancing synergy with solo precision, all while navigating the intensity of a proctored environment. This wasn’t about crossing a finish line; it was about discovering new ways to approach challenges and emerging more adaptable. As I noted on LinkedIn, “Every experience doesn’t have to be a win to be worthwhile, some simply shape you better for the next 🚀.” To anyone eyeing a hackathon: jump in. The real victory lies in the skills you sharpen and the perspective you gain. Here’s to coding bolder and dreaming bigger! 🌟
